Smartphone VR headsets are a great way to try virtual reality without spending a fortune. They’re the only midrange options between cheap cardboard viewers and <br>
expensive, complicated desktop VR devices. In our testing, the Google Daydream View narrowly beat out the Samsung Gear VR as the best mobile virtual reality <br>headset. It’s comfier to wear and comes with a hand-tracking controller that makes gameplay easier and more immersive. However, the competition is so close, and <br>the tech so new, that you can’t go wrong picking whichever headset works with your phone. (Our main picks support only a handful of Android phones each; iPhone <br>owners don’t have good VR options yet.) If you don’t have a phone that works with either, VR isn’t enough reason to buy one, but it could be a factor next time <br>you purchase a phone</pre></p>
